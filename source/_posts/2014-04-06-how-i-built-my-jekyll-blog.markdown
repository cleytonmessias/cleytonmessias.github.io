Hi!

Thanks for getting in here!

For the initial post, I'm gonna write all the things I'm using to build this blog. As many things I intend to write, nothing magical.

Just to start, in my <a href="{{ root_url }}/about">about page</a> I explain the reasons why I'm writing this blog.

Being a blog focused in software development, I thought it will be cool to use something new for me to learn and post about it. So, I decided to use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>.

Googling a little more, I found this really cool platform built on top of Jekyll: <a href="http://octopress.org/" target="_blank">Octopress, a blogging framework for hackers</a>. So far, everything that was needed was simple just by following its documentation. As a developer, I'm feeling some freedom to customize and use it. Fast and clean!

To do my about page, I've followed these <a href="http://gangmax.me/blog/2012/05/04/add-about-page-in-octopress/" target="_blank">simple steps</a>.

As a theme for my blog, I'm using this <a href="https://github.com/johnkeith/boldandblue" target="_blank">really nice one</a>. If you to know more, see more themes <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes" target="_blank">here</a>.

I bought this domain at <a href="http://www.godaddy.com">Godaddy</a> and configure it using nice <a href="http://blog.flatironschool.com/post/56900358130/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-octopress-github">post</a>.

For analytics, I've created an account at Google Analytics, but to add it, i'm using <a href="https://segment.io" target="_blank">Segment.IO</a>. This way, I can add more analytics without increasing my page size.

All of this writing is being made in Sublime Text using the <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/MarkdownEditing">Markdown plugin</a>.

As I said, I don't want to show complete solutions, but if you use just one of this links, it'll be worth of doing it :)

Here's a print screen of my editor writing this post:

- How to create a page in Jekyll
- Themes for Octopress
