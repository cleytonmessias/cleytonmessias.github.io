Hi!

Thanks for getting in here!

In my <a href="{{ root_url }}/about">about page</a> I explain the reasons why I'm writing this blog.

To start writing something that may help someone, i'll describe what i've used to build this blog. As many things that I intend to write, nothing magical.

Being a blog focused in software development, I thought it will be cool to use something new for me to learn and post about it. So, I decided to do this blog using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

Googling a little more, I found this really cool platform built on top of Jekyll: <a href="http://octopress.org/" target="_blank">Octopress, a blogging framework for hackers</a>. So far, everything that was needed was simple just by following its documentation.

To do my about page, I've followed this <a href="http://gangmax.me/blog/2012/05/04/add-about-page-in-octopress/">simple steps</a>.

As a theme for my blog, I'm using this <a href="https://github.com/johnkeith/boldandblue" target="_blank">really nice one</a>.

I bought this domain at <a href="http://www.godaddy.com">Godaddy</a> and configure it using nice <a href="http://blog.flatironschool.com/post/56900358130/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-octopress-github">post</a>.

All of this writing is being made in Sublime Text using the <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/MarkdownEditing">Markdown plugin</a>.

As I said, I don't want to show complete solutions, but if you used just one of this links, it'll be worth of doing it :)
