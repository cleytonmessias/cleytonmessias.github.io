My name is <a href="http://www.twitter.com/cleytonm" target="_blank">Cleyton Messias</a>
and I'm the CTO at <a href="http://site.trustvox.com.br">Trustvox</a>.

I've created this blog as way for keeping some small discoveries in software development. I don't intend to write complete solutions, but just small pieces of code that can be used in your own solution.

**But why this?** As your products grows, usually you have to combine different ways of doing stuff in order to attend your needs, so, there are cases where solutions found googling just don't fit your application without adaptation. So that's why my only intention is giving some small solutions to small problems. It's your call how and where you're going to use it ;)

I'm a brazilian and live in San Paulo.

**Dude, but if you're a brazilian, why this blog is written in English?**

For SEO purposes! Even brazilian developers are used to search content in english.
