<p>Hi!</p>

<p>Thanks for getting in here!</p>

<p>In my <a href="" title="/about">about page</a> I explain the reasons why I&rsquo;m writing this blog.</p>

<p>To start writing something that may help someone, i&rsquo;ll describe what i&rsquo;ve used to build this blog. As many things that I intend to write, nothing magical.</p>

<p>Being a blog focused in software development, I think it will be cool to use something new to me to learn and post about it. So, I decided to do this blog using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.</p>

<p>Googling a little more, I found this really cool platform built on top of Jekyll: <a href="http://octopress.org/" target="_blank">Octopress, a blogging framework for hackers</a>. So far, everything that was needed was simple just by following its documentation.</p>

<p>As a theme for my blog, I&rsquo;m using this <a href="https://github.com/johnkeith/boldandblue" target="_blank"></a>really nice one.</p>
